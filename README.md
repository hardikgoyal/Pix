Seller uploads a photo (which is hashed) and a price.
Make the photo a token, the seller can sell that token (photo).

Buyers check what tokens (photo) that are available and buy the token (photo).

Token would have hash and price attribute.
This would be minted everytime the sellers uploads a photo to the Dapp.

Transaction?
Buyer would request to buy a token in exchange for ether.
The buyer would receive a copy of the token to use.
This token would have an attribute that says it is not the original token, but a bought one.
